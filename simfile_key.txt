STAB revision 1.0 parameter key

Notes: each parameter can be modified by modifying the number behind the tagword. The tagword is the parameter name
behind the > symbol. When the file is read into the program, it searches for the tagword, then reads the text immediately
following. You can write things in your simfiles, but do not write the tagword, otherwise the program will get confused
and attempt to read whatever text follows as the value for the parameter. Best case it will crash, worse case it will
press forward with the wrong value.

Example:
> xdim 100
You can modify the 100 to 200 if you like. This changes the number of cells in the x dimension.

Note the types of values each parameter is, such that integers are only specified integer values, etc. Do not try to
Give a double xdim for example because this makes little sense and may crash the program.

Note that some of the names used here are different than in the paper. For example, Q_advection is labeled
as Q[dflow] in the paper. Q_squish here is Q[lat] in the paper. The flux control parameters are similarly different.

Please contact me (tbarchyn@gmail.com) if you have questions or I have left out some key piece of information. If
you would like to replicate the simulations in the paper, please contact me and I can send you a link to download
the simfiles.

R parameters for running R scripts
Rscript_path = the path to your Rscript.exe on your computer. String.
progress_utility_name = R_main.R, this is the R file to call in analysis. String.
on_the_fly_progress_updates = no, make images at every interim file output ('yes'), or at the end ('no'). String.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boundaries
boundaries_ns = periodic, 'periodic' or 'nonperiodic' in north south direction. String.
boundaries_ew = periodic, 'periodic' or 'nonperiodic' in east west direction. String.

interim_file_output_interval = the interval of interim file outputs, in iterations. Integer. iterations.
file_output_prefix = the prefix for file outputs, could be a path. String.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialization parameters (note existing files must match dimensions set above)

R parameters for running R scripts
Notes: this section defines where to call R and make images and plots and perform
general post-run data analysis.

Rscript_path = this is the path to the Rscript.exe program. If you have set your
    'Path' environment variable to include the path to the directory that contains
    Rscript.exe (recommended), you can just set this to Rscript. Else, you will need
    to include the full path to Rscript.exe. On Linux computers, installing R usually
    sets it up such that you can call Rscript with just 'Rscript'. Not sure about Macs.
progress_utility_name = this is the name of the progress utility to call from STAB. String.
    This could be changed to something different, check the file to get some ideas on
    what could be done here to have simulation specific image outputs. String.
on_the_fly_progress_updates = if this is 'yes', the progress utility is called every
    time a file output occurs. Else, if this is 'no', it calls it only at the end. Set
    this to 'yes' to see the simulation proceed as images will be produced every interim
    output interval. Else, set to no to save some time as making all the images at once
    is faster as the overhead of starting R and loading the libraries only occurs once. String.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boundaries
boundaries_ns = 'periodic' or 'nonperiodic' for specifying boundaries in the north-south
    direction. I have not tested 'nonperiodic' boundaries.
boundaries_ew = 'periodic' or 'nonperiodic' for specifying boundaries in the east-west
    direction. I have not tested 'nonperiodic' boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interim output options
interim_file_output_interval = the interval of iterations to output files. Integer.
file_output_prefix = the prefix of output files, this could be a path if you want
    to put outputs somewhere else except local. String.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialization
init_type = this is the initialization type for the model space. There are some initializations
    defined in the stab.hpp header file, but 'flat' is the only one really tested. String.
flat_init_basement_elev = the elevation of the basement in zsc. Double.
flat_init_sedfill_elev = the elevation to fill with sediment in zsc. Double.
bumpify_multiplier = the bumpification of either surface or basement, see stab.hpp. Leave
    at 0.0 unless you read the code and figure out what it does. Not real important, more
    of a legacy feature. Double.
init_iceload = the initial amount of iceload assigned to the iceload raster. Double.
