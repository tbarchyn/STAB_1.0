STAB revision 1.0 parameter key

Notes: each parameter can be modified by modifying the number behind the tagword. The tagword is the parameter name
behind the > symbol. When the file is read into the program, it searches for the tagword, then reads the text immediately
following. You can write things in your simfiles, but do not write the tagword, otherwise the program will get confused
and attempt to read whatever text follows as the value for the parameter. Best case it will crash, worse case it will
press forward with the wrong value.

Example:
> xdim 100
You can modify the 100 to 200 if you like. This changes the number of cells in the x dimension.

Note the types of values each parameter is, such that integers are only specified integer values, etc. Do not try to
Give a double xdim for example because this makes little sense and may crash the program.

Note that some of the names used here are different than in the paper. For example, Q_advection is labeled
as Q[dflow] in the paper. Q_squish here is Q[lat] in the paper. The flux control parameters are similarly different.

Please contact me (tbarchyn@gmail.com) if you have questions or I have left out some key piece of information. If
you would like to replicate the simulations in the paper, please contact me and I can send you a link to download
the simfiles.
