# STAB_1.0
Subglacial Till Advection and Bedforms (STAB)

This model simulates sediment advection under glaciers.

Please let me know if you are using this model (tbarchyn@gmail.com), for two reasons: (i) I can let you know if I find a bug, and (ii) I require some idea of user numbers to justify spending time on making usability improvements. I'm happy working with the model in a raw form, but I know how it works. If you would appreciate things like extra documentation, tutorials, GUIs, etc. I need your encouragement.
