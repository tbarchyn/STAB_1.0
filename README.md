Subglacial Till Advection and Bedforms (STAB)

This model simulates sediment advection under glaciers. This program has no warranty whatsoever!

This model is part of the following paper:

Barchyn, T. E., T. P. F. Dowling, C. R. Stokes, and C. H. Hugenholtz (2016), Subglacial bed form morphology controlled by ice
speed and sediment thickness, Geophys. Res. Lett., 43, doi:10.1002/2016GL069558

We would appreciate citation of this paper. Please get in touch for more details or if you are interested in specific results (tbarchyn@gmail.com).

Please contact me if you are using this model (tbarchyn@gmail.com), or fork it within Github. This is for three reasons. First, I may be able to help you get the model working or help with ambiguous parameters. Second, I can let you know if I find an important bug. And third, I require some idea of user numbers to build a case for devoting time to useability improvements. I'm happy working with the model in a raw form, but I know how it works. If you would appreciate things like extra documentation, tutorials, GUIs, etc. I your encouragement.
