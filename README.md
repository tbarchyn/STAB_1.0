# STAB_1.0
Subglacial Till Advection and Bedforms (STAB)

This model simulates sediment advection under glaciers. This program has no warranty whatsoever!

This model is part of a paper under preparation. We would appreciate citation of this paper. Please get in touch for more details or if you are interested in specific results (tbarchyn@gmail.com). Also note, a parameter key is forthcoming.

Please contact me if you are using this model (tbarchyn@gmail.com), or fork it within Github. This is for three reasons, all of which are in your interest. First, I may be able to help you get the model working or help with ambiguous parameters, I would not be too pleased if you misinterpreted how the parameters worked accidentally (neither would you!). Second, I can let you know if I find an important bug. And third, I require some idea of user numbers to justify making useability improvements. I'm happy working with the model in a raw form, but I know how it works. If you would appreciate things like extra documentation, tutorials, GUIs, etc. I need your encouragement.
